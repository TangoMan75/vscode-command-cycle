üîÅ TangoMan vscode-command-cycle
================================

The **TangoMan vscode-command-cycle** extension for _Visual Studio Code_ enables the repeated execution of a user-defined sequence of commands. These command sequences are configured within the `keybindings.json` file, providing a customizable workflow.

üöÄ Installation
---------------

### Step 1: Install the Extension

Launch _VSCode Quick Open_ (`Ctrl+P`), paste the following command, and press `Enter`.

```
ext install TangoMan75.command-cycle
```

Or install the extension via the command line:

```bash
code --install-extension TangoMan75.command-cycle
```

Or install the `.vsix` package manually:

1. Download the source code.
2. Open the _Extensions View_ in _VSCode_.
3. Click on the Extensions icon in the _Activity Bar_.
4. Click on the three-dot icon (`...`) in the top-right corner.
5. From the dropdown menu that appears, select "`Install from VSIX...`".

### Step 2: Configure Keybindings

Edit your _VSCode_ keybindings configuration in the `keybindings.json` file to define the commands to cycle through.

For example, while using the `wmaurer.change-case` extension, you can cycle through various text case transformations (e.g., sentence case, title case, camelCase, etc.) by pressing `Ctrl+K Ctrl+T` repeatedly.

```json
{
    "key": "ctrl+k ctrl+t",
    "command": "command-cycle.loop",
    "args": {
        "commands": [
            "extension.changeCase.sentence",
            "extension.changeCase.title",
            "extension.changeCase.camel",
            "extension.changeCase.pascal"
        ]
    },
    "when": "editorTextFocus && !editorReadonly"
},
```

Replace the commands in the `commands` array with the ones you want to cycle through.

üî• Usage
--------

1. Press the keybinding you configured (e.g., `Ctrl+K Ctrl+T`).
2. The extension will execute the commands in the order specified in the `commands` array.
3. Each subsequent key press will execute the next command in the cycle.

üìù Notes
--------

- Ensure that the commands you specify in the `commands` array are valid Visual Studio Code commands.
- You can find available commands by opening the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and typing `>`.
